# Simulation code
The scripts in this folder are used to run the different simulations for the publication. Note that a separate installation of SlideForce is required. Also note that the publicly available version of SlideForce from [ecorisQ](https://www.ecorisq.org/) doesn't support all functions used in the simulations yet.

- __run_runout_simulations.py__: Runs the runout simulations for the historical landslides with variable forest friction that serve as the basis for the main analysis of the paper.
- __run_runout_simulations_sensitivity_constant_slope.py__: Runs the simulations for the sensitivity analysis on a constant gradient slope.
- __run_runout_simulations_sensitivity_forest_variable.py__: Runs the simulations for the sensitivity analysis for the historical landslides in the forest.
- __postprocess_runout_simulations.py__: Runs postprocessing for the simulations for the historical landslides.
- __postprocess_runout_simulations.py__: Runs the postprocessing for the simulations for the sensitivity analysis on a constant gradient slope. 
- __postprocess_sensitivity_analysis_forest.py__: Runs the postprocessing for the sensitivity analysis for the historical landslides in the forest.
