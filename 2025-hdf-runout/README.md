# Development and testing of a robust model for simulating hillslope debris flow propagation (2025)
This folder contains the code used for data preparation, simulation, and result analysis used in the publication. Note that that only the reference data for the historical landslides and the summarized simulation results needed to recreate the publication graphics is included:
- __python__: This folder contains code used for input data preparation, running the simulations for the historical landslides, running the sensitivity analysis, and the result analysis. See the separate readme files for further details.
